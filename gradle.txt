I'm learning about Gradle.

+ I created a boilerplate java project in intellij.
+ Then I added a class with an external dependency, Gson.
+ Then I manually added the Gson jar file (external library)
+ I never really built the project, I just added a simple main and executed directly
+ That worked, but was kind of annoying...

Gradle solves some of these problems
+ If I want to update Gson, apparently Gradle helps with that
+ I also get some neato tasks I can execute from the command line, like...
+ `gradle build` builds the whole thing
+ `gradle test` runs the tests
+ `gradle jar` creates a jar


Speaking of which...What's a jar?
+ I read on wikipedia a jar (Java ARchive) is file format that allows retrieving all classes and resources in a single request
+ I also tried `jar -xf gson-2.8.2.jar` to extract the contents of gson to see what's going on and I looked at the manifest
